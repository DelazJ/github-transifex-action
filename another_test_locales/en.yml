      quote_one: Life is like music for its own sake. We are living in an eternal now, and when we listen to music we are not listening to the past, we are not listening to the future, we are listening to an expanded present.
      quote_two: No valid plans for the future can be made by those who have no capacity for living now.
      quote_three: I have realized that the past and future are real illusions, that they exist in the present, which is what there is and all there is.
      quote_four: Trying to define yourself is like trying to bite your own teeth.
